# bigideas Code of Conduct

bigideas is a fun school project started by three college students. It is primarily made as an open-source coding project. **Any and all** contribution in any form is appreciated and welcome. We just require each contribution to be made as a pull request. Gl hf REMOVETHISLATER

1. **Be friendly and patient**.

2. **Be welcoming**. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
   people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
   to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color,
   immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
   orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
   status, technological or professional choices, academic
   discipline, religion, mental ability, and physical ability.

3. **Be considerate**. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
   will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
   and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
   making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community. You may be
   communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
   background.

4. **Be respectful**. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
   no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
   frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
   personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
   feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

5. **Be careful in the words that you choose**. Be kind to others. Do not insult
   or put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary
   behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
   * Violent threats or violent language directed against another person
   * Discriminatory jokes and language
   * Posting sexually explicit or violent material
   * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
     information ("doxing")
   * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms
   * Unwelcome sexual attention
   * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
   * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
     then stop

6. **Moderate your expectations**. Please respect that community members choose
   how they spend their time in the project. A thoughtful question about your
   expectations is preferable to demands for another person's time.

7. **When we disagree, try to understand why**. Disagreements, both social and
   technical, happen all the time and Jupyter is no exception.  Try to
   understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from their
   viewpoint may help find a new path forward.  And don’t forget that it is
   human to err: blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere, while we can learn
   from mistakes to find better solutions.

8. **A simple apology can go a long way**. It can often de-escalate a situation,
   and telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn’t
   automatically imply an admission of guilt. 


## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please report this in
a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community
for everyone and we take them seriously.

You can file a report by emailing
[*zht17@pitt.edu*](mailto:zht17@pitt.edu) or making a simple pull request upon the creation of a .md file in the following format:
```
# Misconduct report by <name here>
<report here>
```
